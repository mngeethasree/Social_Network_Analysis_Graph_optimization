    "# Project Background\n",
    "Online social networks have become ubiquitous in our society. Although the first such network is\n",
    "hard to determine, it is commonly believed to have been the website SixDegrees which was stared\n",
    "in 1997 and lasted approximately 4 years. From this website the social media craze was born,\n",
    "with Friendster, Myspace, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and many others spawning and growing in\n",
    "use and popularity since then, connecting people from all over the world in ways never previously\n",
    "imagined.\n",
    "Social networks are not just used for connecting people —they have become one of the main mechanisms for companies to reach customers through targeted marketing, recruiting, increasing company\n",
    "credibility, increasing the quality of feedback on products on services, among many others. These\n",
    "tasks, and many others, rely on Social Network Analysis (SNA), which, according to Wikipedia1\n",
    ",\n",
    "can be defined as ‘the process of investigating social structures through the use of networks and\n",
    "network theories.’\n",
    "In this project, you will be given two social network networks, one small and one large, and be asked\n",
    "to build spreadsheet models to solve some problems some typically SNA problem. The files are in\n",
    "Excel file SocialNetworks.xlsx in sheets Small and Large. The Small sheet contains a social\n",
    "network with 25 individuals and the Large sheet contains a social network with 50 individuals. For\n",
    "each individuals, in sequence, the links that they have in the network are given. For example, in\n",
    "the Large network, individual 9 is connected with individuals 7,8,26, and 29. You are to answer\n",
    "each of the following questions for each of the networks.\n"
